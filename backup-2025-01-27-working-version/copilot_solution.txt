Your job failed for two primary reasons:

1. Build Error – Missing File:
   The build process failed to copy a file:
   ENOENT: no such file or directory, copyfile '/home/runner/work/Jewelry.Website/Jewelry.Website/.next/server/app/(shop)/page_client-reference-mani'
   This indicates a missing or misnamed file, likely produced during your Next.js build. This can happen if a dynamic route or page was recently deleted or renamed, or if the build artifacts are out of sync.

   Solution:
   - Double-check your app/(shop)/page.js (or .tsx) and related dynamic route files. If you recently removed or renamed files, make sure to clear the .next build cache locally and in CI before building:
     rm -rf .next
     Add a step in your CI workflow before building:
     - name: Clean .next build cache
       run: rm -rf .next
   - Ensure that all required files for your dynamic routes are present and correctly named.

2. Test Failure – Accessibility Test:
   The test suite __tests__/unit/accessibility.test.tsx failed:
   FAIL __tests__/unit/accessibility.test.tsx
     ● Accessibility › homepage has no violations
   Three tests failed in total. You need to check the details of these failed tests (the log does not show the specific error message, but the problem is likely related to accessibility violations on the homepage).

   Solution:
   - Open __tests__/unit/accessibility.test.tsx and examine the test case for homepage has no violations.
   - Run the test locally with verbose output:
     npm test __tests__/unit/accessibility.test.tsx -- --verbose
   - Address the specific accessibility issues reported (these are often missing ARIA attributes, missing alt text, or improper heading structure).
   - Example fix (if an image is missing alt text in your homepage component):
     <img src="..." alt="Describe the image" />

Summary of Actions to Fix:
- Clean the .next directory before building to prevent artifact issues.
- Make sure all route/page files exist and are correctly referenced.
- Investigate and fix the accessibility violations reported by your failing test.
