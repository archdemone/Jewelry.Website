Prompt to Cursor Agent (Node 14 + Tailwind)

Role
Act as a Senior Front-End Engineer & UI/UX Lead for a UK jewelry e-commerce site. Audit the site’s visual UI and UX end-to-end, then produce a prioritized plan that keeps the interface premium, trustworthy, fast, and accessible. Stack specifics: Node.js 14 (Express/SSR or server-rendered templates) and Tailwind CSS.

Inputs
- Repo: {{repo link}}
- Live URL(s): {{staging/production URL}}
- Brand/tokens: {{link or brief}}
- KPIs: conversion, add-to-cart, checkout completion, AOV, search/filter usage.

Reference Benchmarks (UK jewelry)
Use these to identify good patterns and to call out anti-patterns (don’t name-and-shame; list issues): Goldsmiths (UK), Beaverbrooks, H.Samuel, Ernest Jones, Monica Vinader, Missoma, Astrid & Miyu, Pandora (UK). Consider: product photography quality, card hierarchy, filter drawers, PDP variant clarity, financing/returns messaging.

Standards & Targets
- CWV (mobile): LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.10.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA): contrast, focus, keyboard nav, target size ≥ 44×44, motion prefs.
- Responsiveness: mobile-first; fluid type/spacing; key breakpoints ~360/480/768/1024/1280+.
- Performance: AVIF/WEBP, responsive images, critical CSS, defer non-critical JS, code-split routes, lazy-load below the fold, font subsetting with font-display: optional.

2. Home: hero clarity, value props, social proof, featured categories.
3. PLP/Category: product card hierarchy, filters/sort (mobile drawer), pagination, empty-states.
4. Search: typeahead, synonyms (“studs”/“earrings”), zero-results.
5. PDP: gallery (zoom/alt views/video/360), variant selection, delivery/returns, size guide, certifications, financing, reviews.
6. Cart/Checkout: mini-cart, promo flow, guest checkout, payment options (Apple/Google Pay), errors.
7. Account/Wishlist: sign-in friction, wishlist share, back-in-stock.

Tailwind & Node-Specific Implementation Guidance

Tailwind config (design tokens)
/* Example tailwind.config.js snippet inside */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./views/**/*.{html,ejs}", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['ui-sans-serif','system-ui','-apple-system','"Segoe UI"','Roboto','Inter','"Noto Sans"','sans-serif'],
    },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        accent: { DEFAULT: "#0F172A", soft: "#1E293B" },
        gold: "#C8A96A",
        success: "#16a34a",
        danger: "#dc2626",
      },
      spacing: { 18: "4.5rem" },
      borderRadius: { xl: "1rem", "2xl": "1.25rem" },
      boxShadow: { card: "0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require("@tailwindcss/typography"),
    require("@tailwindcss/forms"),
    require("@tailwindcss/line-clamp"),
    require("@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio"),
  ],
}

Critical Tailwind patterns
- Product cards, variant selectors, filter drawers, sticky ATC bar examples included.

Node 14 / Express performance
- Use helmet, compression, static caching, brotli pre-compression, SSR streaming, defer non-critical scripts.

Accessibility
- Tailwind focus-visible rings, prefers-reduced-motion guards.

Checkout
- Guest checkout, Apple/Google Pay, promo code as disclosure.

Deliverables
1) Audit Report (Markdown)
- Exec summary, page-by-page, issue tables, performance, accessibility, design system gaps, benchmarks.
2) Actionable Checklist (copy-pasteable)
- GOOD (Keep/Leverage)
- CRITICAL (Fix Next Sprint)
- OPTIONAL (Nice-to-Have)

Implementation guidance: include Tailwind/Node snippets with each critical item.

Output Format
- Audit Report first
- Checklist second with exact headings above
- Reference pages/components precisely

Constraints
- Keep brand premium, avoid template look
- Prioritize high-impact, low-effort
- Avoid backend coupling unless necessary
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

Start now. If any inputs are missing, make reasonable assumptions and proceed. At the end, deliver the audit + the three-part checklist.
