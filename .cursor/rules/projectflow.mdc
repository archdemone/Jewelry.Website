# Sandbox Workflow
1. Work ONLY inside sandbox when experimenting.
2. After changes: run `npm run smoke:all`. If any fail, fix and re-run.
3. Promotion:
   - Create patch from sandbox â†’ apply to main.
   - Re-run `smoke:all` on main before commit.
4. Never copy files manually between trees; use the patch flow.
