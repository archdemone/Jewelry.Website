# Reporting Requirements
- For every request: print exact commands, exit codes, JSON outputs, and a brief diff of changed files.
- If a step fails: stop, show logs, propose a fix, retry once automatically, then report status.
- Never claim success without proof (200/ok:true or build success).

Memory 3 — Safety, Promotion & Reporting (how to behave):

Baseline protection: Do not modify main unless I say “promote/apply patch.”

Promotion flow: In sandbox npm run sandbox:patch → in main npm run sandbox:apply → commit. Never copy files manually.

Installs: If sandbox install fails, sync package.json + package-lock.json from main, then npm ci. Retry once, then STOP and report.

Reporting: Always show commands + exit codes, npm run status, and last 20–50 log lines for each server. Do not change/disable tests to pass. Fail if logs contain Error/Unhandled/TypeError.

Performance targets (context, not a trigger): aim for LCP < 2.5s, TBT < 300ms, CLS < 0.1. Do not start “optimizing” unless I ask.
