- Baseline: 3000 (read-only). Sandbox: 3001 (SANDBOX=1). Do not use other ports.

Memory 1 — Environment & Paths:

OS/Shell/Node: Windows + PowerShell, Node v20 LTS. Use npm ci (deterministic).

Baseline (main): http://localhost:3000 — read-only by default.

Sandbox (worktree): C:\Users\dimam\OneDrive\Desktop\Jewelry.Website\sandbox-20250820-183517 → http://localhost:3001 (start with SANDBOX=1).

Ports: Only 3000/3001. Before starting: npm run stop. Non-interactive commands only.

Scope: Work only in the sandbox unless I say “promote/apply patch.” If sandbox path is missing, STOP and report (do not create new folders).
