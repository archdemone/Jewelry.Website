# Maintenance Guide

## Routine Tasks

- Daily: Verify backups completed successfully
- Weekly: Review error logs and performance dashboards
- Monthly: Update dependencies and security patches
- Quarterly: Disaster recovery drill and restore test

## Maintenance Mode

- Toggle `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_MODE` to "true" in environment
- Optionally route all traffic to `/maintenance`

## Database

- Index monitoring and vacuum (PostgreSQL)
- Run `scripts/backup-database.js` for on-demand backups

## Monitoring

- Review Sentry issues and set alerts
- Check uptime dashboards
- Track Core Web Vitals

## Security

- Rotate API keys and secrets periodically
- Audit user roles and admin access
- Run dependency vulnerability scans

## Scaling Strategy

### Current Setup (0-1000 orders/month)

- Single server
- PostgreSQL database
- Local image storage

### Phase 2 (1000-5000 orders/month)

- Load balancer
- 2-3 app servers
- Database replication
- CDN for static assets
- Redis caching

### Phase 3 (5000+ orders/month)

- Kubernetes cluster
- Database clustering
- Elasticsearch for search
- Queue system (Bull/RabbitMQ)
- Microservices architecture

## Disaster Recovery

- Restore latest backup from cloud storage
- Run `psql $DATABASE_URL < backups/backup-YYYY-MM-DD.sql` for local restores
- Validate integrity and app functionality post-restore
